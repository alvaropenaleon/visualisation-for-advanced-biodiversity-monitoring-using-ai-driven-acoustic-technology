# Digitalisation AIO Package

The **Digitalisation AIO (All-In-One) Package** is a comprehensive Docker-based stack that integrates tools for automation, data management, and visualisation. It is designed to facilitate efficient workflows, seamless communication, and insightful analysis.

## Components
- **Node-RED**: Automates workflows and orchestrates communication.
- **PostgreSQL**: Manages and stores time-series data.
- **Mosquitto**: Enables MQTT-based messaging between services.
- **Grafana**: Provides data visualisation and analytics.

---

## Key Features
- Pre-configured Mosquitto broker with secure authentication.
- Node-RED flows demonstrating:
  - MQTT communication.
  - PostgreSQL integration for database creation and data management.
- Ready-to-use Grafana dashboard template for visualising time-series data.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
1. **Docker Desktop** with WSL2 (Ubuntu).
2. Docker Desktop should be linked to your WSL2 instance.

### Setup Steps
1. Clone this repository, and update ownership.
```
git clone https://github.com/ctch3ng/Digitalisation-AIO-Package.git
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 Digitalisation-AIO-Package/
```
2. Configure the `.env` file with your preferred credentials. (You can skip this if you just want to give it a test drive)
- Set your PostgreSQL password. The default password is `05JDÂ£AEBW2'f`.
- Define Grafana admin credentials. The default username and password are `admin` and `0m{-}>7nP8)C`, respectively. 
3. Launch the stack:
```
docker-compose up -d
```
4. Access the services:
- Node-RED: [http://localhost:1880](http://localhost:1880)
- Grafana: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

5. Updating Mosquitto's credentials
- Enter the Mosquitto container:
```bash
docker exec -it digitalisation-aio-mosquitto sh
```
  (Use `docker ps` to confirm the container name. Here, the name in the example is `digitalisation-aio-mosquitto`)

- Navigate to the password file directory:
```bash
cd /mosquitto/config
```
- Update the password file (Here, the default username and password are `mqtt_user1` and `P71X95tQ!]tm`:
```bash
rm passwordfile
echo "mqtt_user1:P71X95tQ!]tm" > passwordfile
chmod 0700 passwordfile
```
- Hash the password file:
```bash
mosquitto_passwd -U passwordfile
```
- Exit the container:
```bash
exit
```

# Node-RED Demo
Import the `flows.json` from the `node-red-data/` directory. This demo showcases:

1. Communicating with Mosquitto using container names.
2. Interfacing with PostgreSQL for:
 - Creating tables.
 - Populating times-eries data.
 - Retrieving data for analysis.

# Grafana Dashboard
 - Import the `dashboard-template.json` from the `grafana-data/` directory into Grafana.
 - Configure Grafana to connect to the PostgreSQL database.
 - Explore visualisations and analytics for time-series data.
